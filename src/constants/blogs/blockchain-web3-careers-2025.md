## Introduction

The internet is evolving—again. With the rise of **Web3** and **Blockchain technology**, we’re witnessing a shift toward decentralized systems, smart contracts, and trustless applications that are changing everything from finance to identity to the way we build software.

If you're preparing for the future of tech, now is the time to build **Web3 and Blockchain skills**. At **Tech Vista Code**, we offer fully online training that blends technical depth with practical project-based learning—so you can build, deploy, and even launch your own decentralized applications (dApps).

## Why Blockchain & Web3 Are the Future

While once associated only with cryptocurrencies, Blockchain has matured into a foundational layer of **transparent, tamper-proof systems** across industries. Web3 builds on this to create decentralized internet experiences that return control to users.

Here’s why you should care:

- **Decentralization is the trend:** From finance (DeFi) to social media (Lens Protocol) and identity (ENS), Web3 is expanding fast.
- **Trustless and secure:** Blockchain enables systems without intermediaries—ideal for transparency and safety.
- **Smart contracts = smart jobs:** Demand for Solidity and smart contract developers is growing rapidly in India and globally.
- **Early mover advantage:** The Web3 space is still young; building now means shaping the ecosystem.

## What You’ll Learn in Our Blockchain & Web3 Program

This course is designed to help you go from zero to launch-ready. Here's what you’ll cover:

- **Blockchain fundamentals**: blocks, consensus, hashing, and proof systems
- **Ethereum ecosystem**: understanding EVM, wallets, gas, and nodes
- **Smart contract development**: writing contracts with Solidity
- **dApp development**: building frontend apps that interact with the blockchain
- **Working with tools**: Hardhat, MetaMask, Alchemy, IPFS
- **Decentralized storage**: using IPFS and Filecoin
- **NFTs and token standards**: ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155
- **Intro to Web3 security, auditing, and compliance**

By the end of the course, you’ll have launched your own functional dApp to showcase your skills.

## Career Paths in Blockchain & Web3

Even in a competitive tech landscape, Blockchain roles are rising sharply. Here’s what you could aim for:

| Role                     | Average Salary (₹ per annum) |
